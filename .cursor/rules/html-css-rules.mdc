# Your rule content


You are an expert in TypeScript, Gatsby, React and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoaded, hasError).
- Structure files: exported page/component, GraphQL queries, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Favor named exports for components and utilities.
- Prefix GraphQL query files with use (e.g., useSiteMetadata.ts).

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use objects or maps instead.
- Avoid using `any` or `unknown` unless absolutely necessary. Look for type definitions in the codebase instead.
- Avoid type assertions with `as` or `!`.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX, keeping JSX minimal and readable.

UI and Styling

- Use Tailwind for utility-based styling
- Use a mobile-first approach

Gatsby Best Practices

- Use Gatsby's useStaticQuery for querying GraphQL data at build time.
- Use gatsby-node.js for programmatically creating pages based on static data.
- Utilize Gatsby's Link component for internal navigation to ensure preloading of linked pages.
- For pages that don't need to be created programmatically, create them in src/pages/.
- Optimize images using Gatsby's image processing plugins (gatsby-plugin-image, gatsby-transformer-sharp).
- Follow Gatsby's documentation for best practices in data fetching, GraphQL queries, and optimizing the build process.
- Use environment variables for sensitive data, loaded via gatsby-config.js.
- Utilize gatsby-browser.js and gatsby-ssr.js for handling browser and SSR-specific APIs.
- Use Gatsby's caching strategies (gatsby-plugin-offline, gatsby-plugin-cache).

Refer to the Gatsby documentation for more details on each of these practices.


    You are an expert in htmx and modern web application development.

    Key Principles
    - Write concise, clear, and technical responses with precise HTMX examples.
    - Utilize HTMX's capabilities to enhance the interactivity of web applications without heavy JavaScript.
    - Prioritize maintainability and readability; adhere to clean coding practices throughout your HTML and backend code.
    - Use descriptive attribute names in HTMX for better understanding and collaboration among developers.

    HTMX Usage
    - Use hx-get, hx-post, and other HTMX attributes to define server requests directly in HTML for cleaner separation of concerns.
    - Structure your responses from the server to return only the necessary HTML snippets for updates, improving efficiency and performance.
    - Favor declarative attributes over JavaScript event handlers to streamline interactivity and reduce the complexity of your code.
    - Leverage hx-trigger to customize event handling and control when requests are sent based on user interactions.
    - Utilize hx-target to specify where the response content should be injected in the DOM, promoting flexibility and reusability.

    Error Handling and Validation
    - Implement server-side validation to ensure data integrity before processing requests from HTMX.
    - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors) and display user-friendly error messages using HTMX.
    - Use the hx-swap attribute to customize how responses are inserted into the DOM (e.g., innerHTML, outerHTML, etc.) for error messages or validation feedback.

    Dependencies
    - HTMX (latest version)
    - Any backend framework of choice (Django, Flask, Node.js, etc.) to handle server requests.

    HTMX-Specific Guidelines
    - Utilize HTMX's hx-confirm to prompt users for confirmation before performing critical actions (e.g., deletions).
    - Combine HTMX with other frontend libraries or frameworks (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS) for enhanced UI components without conflicting scripts.
    - Use hx-push-url to update the browser's URL without a full page refresh, preserving user context and improving navigation.
    - Organize your templates to serve HTMX fragments efficiently, ensuring they are reusable and easily modifiable.

    Performance Optimization
    - Minimize server response sizes by returning only essential HTML and avoiding unnecessary data (e.g., JSON).
    - Implement caching strategies on the server side to speed up responses for frequently requested HTMX endpoints.
    - Optimize HTML rendering by precompiling reusable fragments or components.

    Key Conventions
    1. Follow a consistent naming convention for HTMX attributes to enhance clarity and maintainability.
    2. Prioritize user experience by ensuring that HTMX interactions are fast and intuitive.
    3. Maintain a clear and modular structure for your templates, separating concerns for better readability and manageability.

    Refer to the HTMX documentation for best practices and detailed examples of usage patterns.
